Before asking you to wear a blue sapphire or neelam the person recommending it to you will also ask you to test it. Let us discuss how neelam can be tested before actually wearing it.\n\nA neelam stone can be worn in ear rings, a finger ring or even as a pendant in a chain. We have already discussed how to recognize a genuine neelam and the points to watch out for while buying a neelam.\n\nWearing a blue sapphire protects against danger, travel problems, terror, thieves, accidents.     \n\nIt can cause financial fortunes to change for the better, help with a person\'s career, and make the wearer rich. It can free one of mental anxiety.\n\nIt helps make one detached, and protects against envy. It can be worn for good luck and for protection against evil spirits.\n\nNeelam stone\'s are found in India, Burma, Ceylon, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Brazil and Africa. From the gemstone mines, the raw crystals are first taken to the cutting-centres where they are turned into sparkling gemstones by skilled hands.\n\nThe most valuable are genuine Kashmir stones. Burmese sapphires are valued almost as highly, and then come the sapphires from Ceylon. The possibility of the gemstone\'s having undergone some treatment or other is also a factor in determining the price,\n\nThe fact that this magnificent gemstone also comes in a large number of other colours was known for a long time almost only to insiders. In the trade, sapphires which are not blue are referred to as \'fancies\'.\n\nThe presence of small amounts of other elements, especially iron and chrome, are responsible for the colouring, turning a crystal that was basically white into a blue, red, yellow, pink or greenish sapphire. However, this does not mean that every corundum is also a sapphire.\n\nThus the blue of the sapphire has become a colour which fits in with everything that is constant and reliable. That is one of the reasons why women in many countries wish for a sapphire ring on their engagement. The sapphire symbolises loyalty, but at the same time it gives expression to people\'s love and longing.")
